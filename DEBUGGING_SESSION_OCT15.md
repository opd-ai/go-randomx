# Debugging Session: Root Cause Analysis

**Date**: October 15, 2025  
**Session Type**: Root Cause Investigation  
**Outcome**: ‚úÖ CRITICAL ISSUE IDENTIFIED  

---

## Session Objective

Investigate why go-randomx hash outputs don't match the official RandomX reference implementation, as identified by the test vector infrastructure implemented earlier today.

## Investigation Process

### Step 1: Test Vector Validation

Ran `TestOfficialVectors` to confirm hash mismatches:

```bash
$ go test -v -run TestOfficialVectors
```

**Results**:
- ‚ùå All 4 test vectors failed
- Hashes completely different (not just off by a few bits)
- Pattern suggests fundamental algorithmic difference, not implementation bug

### Step 2: Component Analysis

Analyzed where hash computation could diverge:
1. Cache generation (Argon2d)
2. Dataset generation (SuperScalar hash)
3. Program generation (Blake2b)
4. VM execution
5. Hash finalization (Blake2b)

**Hypothesis**: Issue likely in cache generation, as it's the foundation for all subsequent operations.

### Step 3: Cache Investigation

Examined RandomX reference implementation cache test:

```cpp
// RandomX/src/tests/tests.cpp
initCache("test key 000");
uint64_t* cacheMemory = (uint64_t*)cache->memory;
assert(cacheMemory[0] == 0x191e0e1d23c02186);
assert(cacheMemory[1568413] == 0xf1b62fe6210bf8b1);
assert(cacheMemory[33554431] == 0x1f47f056d05cd99b);
```

Created diagnostic test in `cache_diagnostic_test.go` to check our cache against these values.

**Result**: Cache values don't match ‚ùå

### Step 4: Argon2 Configuration Verification

Verified RandomX Argon2 parameters from `RandomX/src/configuration.h`:

```c
#define RANDOMX_ARGON_MEMORY       262144  // 256 MB
#define RANDOMX_ARGON_ITERATIONS   3
#define RANDOMX_ARGON_LANES        1
#define RANDOMX_ARGON_SALT         "RandomX\x03"
```

Our implementation matches these parameters ‚úÖ

### Step 5: Argon2 Variant Investigation

üîç **CRITICAL DISCOVERY**:

Checked RandomX Argon2 type in `RandomX/src/argon2.h`:

```c
typedef enum Argon2_type {
    Argon2_d = 0,   // ‚Üê RandomX uses THIS
    Argon2_i = 1,
    Argon2_id = 2
} argon2_type;
```

**RandomX uses Argon2_d (data-dependent mode)**

Checked Go `golang.org/x/crypto/argon2` package:

```
$ go doc golang.org/x/crypto/argon2
```

**Available functions**:
- `Key()` - Implements Argon2**i** (data-independent)
- `IDKey()` - Implements Argon2**id** (hybrid)

**üî¥ Argon2d is NOT available!**

### Step 6: Root Cause Confirmed

**ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED**:

Our implementation uses `argon2.Key()` which implements Argon2**i**, but RandomX requires Argon2**d**. These are fundamentally different algorithms with different memory access patterns:

- **Argon2i**: Data-independent addressing (side-channel resistant)
- **Argon2d**: Data-dependent addressing (faster, used by RandomX)
- **Argon2id**: Hybrid (first half Argon2i, second half Argon2d)

This explains:
- ‚úÖ Why hashes are completely different (not just slightly off)
- ‚úÖ Why determinism works (both are deterministic, just different algorithms)
- ‚úÖ Why all test vectors fail (fundamentally wrong algorithm)

## Impact Assessment

### Severity: CRITICAL

This affects:
- ‚ùå All hash computations
- ‚ùå Monero compatibility
- ‚ùå Mining pool compatibility
- ‚ùå Block validation
- ‚ùå Production readiness

### Scope: Complete

- Every hash produced is incorrect
- Cannot be used for any RandomX-compatible application
- Not a simple bug fix - requires algorithm implementation

## Solution Analysis

### Option 1: Port Argon2d from RandomX ‚≠ê RECOMMENDED

**Approach**: Translate RandomX's C Argon2d implementation to pure Go

**Pros**:
- Maintains "Pure Go" philosophy
- Guaranteed compatibility
- No new dependencies
- Full control

**Cons**:
- Significant effort (3-4 days)
- Requires careful C-to-Go translation
- Need extensive validation

**Files to port**:
- `RandomX/src/argon2_core.c` - Core algorithm
- `RandomX/src/argon2_ref.c` - Reference implementation
- `RandomX/src/argon2.h` - Headers and constants

### Option 2: External Library

**Status**: Investigated - no suitable candidates found

Searched for:
- "golang argon2d"
- "go argon2 data-dependent"
- Pure Go Argon2 implementations

**Finding**: No well-maintained (>1000 stars, active) Go libraries support Argon2d

### Option 3: CGo Binding

**Status**: Rejected - violates project requirements

Using CGo would:
- ‚ùå Break "Pure Go" requirement
- ‚ùå Complicate cross-compilation
- ‚ùå Add C toolchain dependency

## Actions Taken

### 1. Created Argon2d Placeholder

File: `internal/argon2.go`

```go
// Added comprehensive documentation explaining:
// - The Argon2i vs Argon2d issue
// - Why hashes don't match
// - What needs to be fixed
// - Placeholder implementation for continued development
```

**Purpose**: Allow other components to be developed and tested while Argon2d is being implemented.

**Properties**:
- ‚úÖ Deterministic (same input ‚Üí same output)
- ‚úÖ Compiles and runs
- ‚ùå Does NOT match Argon2d
- ‚ùå Produces incompatible hashes

### 2. Documented Issue

Created `ARGON2D_ISSUE.md`:
- Full technical analysis
- Solution options comparison
- Implementation roadmap
- Testing strategy

### 3. Updated PLAN.md

Modified Phase 1 timeline:
- Marked Day 2 complete (root cause found)
- Added Days 3-6 for Argon2d implementation
- Adjusted remaining milestones

### 4. Created Diagnostic Test

File: `cache_diagnostic_test.go`

Tests that verify cache values against RandomX reference. Currently fails (expected) - will pass once Argon2d is implemented.

## Validation

### Code Compiles ‚úÖ

```bash
$ go build ./...
# Success
```

### Tests Pass (Non-Diagnostic) ‚úÖ

```bash
$ go test -run 'TestCache[^R]|TestHasher|TestConfig'
# PASS
```

### Diagnostic Tests Fail (Expected) ‚úÖ

```bash
$ go test -run TestCacheReferenceValues
# FAIL (expected - shows placeholder != reference)
```

### Test Vectors Fail (Expected) ‚úÖ

```bash
$ go test -run TestOfficialVectors
# FAIL (expected - awaiting Argon2d implementation)
```

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Test Vectors Are Critical

The test vector infrastructure immediately identified the root cause. Without it, we might have spent days debugging individual components.

**Takeaway**: Always implement comprehensive test vectors first.

### 2. Verify Cryptographic Primitives

Assumption that `golang.org/x/crypto/argon2` would "just work" was incorrect. Different Argon2 variants exist, and library support varies.

**Takeaway**: Verify cryptographic library capabilities match specification exactly.

### 3. Documentation Prevents Wasted Effort

Clearly documenting the Argon2i vs Argon2d issue prevents future developers from debugging the same problem.

**Takeaway**: Document critical issues thoroughly, even if not yet resolved.

### 4. Systematic Investigation Works

Following a logical investigation path (test vectors ‚Üí components ‚Üí configuration ‚Üí algorithm variant) efficiently identified the root cause.

**Takeaway**: Use systematic debugging methodology, not random changes.

## Success Metrics

### Investigation Phase ‚úÖ COMPLETE

- [x] Identified root cause
- [x] Verified diagnosis with evidence
- [x] Documented findings comprehensively
- [x] Created actionable implementation plan
- [x] Maintained code quality (no regressions)

### Implementation Phase ‚è≥ PENDING

- [ ] Argon2d core algorithm implemented
- [ ] Cache generation matches reference
- [ ] All test vectors pass
- [ ] Performance acceptable (within 2x of C)
- [ ] Code reviewed and documented

## Timeline Impact

**Original Estimate**: 2-3 days for hash debugging  
**Revised Estimate**: 4-5 days (includes Argon2d implementation)  
**Reason**: Identified that issue requires new algorithm implementation, not bug fixing

**Trade-off**: Worth the time investment because:
1. Argon2d is foundational - must be correct
2. Pure Go implementation adds long-term value
3. Avoids CGo complexity
4. Maintains project philosophy

## Conclusion

Successfully identified that golang.org/x/crypto/argon2 provides Argon2i/id but NOT Argon2d, which RandomX requires. This is a fundamental incompatibility requiring a new implementation.

The investigation was methodical, the root cause is clear, and the path forward is well-defined. A placeholder implementation allows continued development of other components while Argon2d is being implemented.

**Status**: Root cause analysis COMPLETE ‚úÖ  
**Next Phase**: Argon2d implementation (Days 3-6)  
**Blocker Identified**: Clear and actionable
